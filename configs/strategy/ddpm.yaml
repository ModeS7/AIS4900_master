# DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models) Strategy
#
# Original diffusion method that predicts the noise added to images.
# Uses Markov chain to gradually denoise from pure noise to clean image.
#
# Reference: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239
#
# Training:
#   1. Add noise to clean image: x_t = sqrt(alpha_t) * x_0 + sqrt(1-alpha_t) * noise
#   2. Model predicts the noise: eps_pred = model(x_t, t)
#   3. Loss: MSE(eps_pred, noise)
#
# Inference:
#   1. Start with pure noise x_T ~ N(0, I)
#   2. Iteratively denoise: x_{t-1} = f(x_t, eps_pred, t)
#   3. Returns clean image x_0
