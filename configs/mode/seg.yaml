# Segmentation Mode - Unconditional mask generation
#
# Generates segmentation masks unconditionally (no conditioning input).
# These masks can then be used to condition image generation.
#
# For DIFFUSION training:
#   in_channels: 1 = noisy_seg
#   out_channels: 1 = predicted seg
#   Dataloader: create_dataloader(image_type='seg')
#
# For VAE training (same channels):
#   in_channels: 1 = seg
#   out_channels: 1
#   Dataloader: create_vae_dataloader()

name: seg
is_conditional: false
in_channels: 1   # noisy_seg only (unconditional)
out_channels: 1  # predicted noise/velocity for seg
image_keys: [seg]  # Which modalities to load
