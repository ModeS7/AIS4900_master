# Segmentation Conditioned Mode - Size bin conditioned mask generation
#
# Generates segmentation masks conditioned on tumor size distribution.
# Uses a 9-dimensional vector where each element is the count of tumors
# in that size bin (Feret diameter, log-scale binning).
#
# Size bins (mm): [0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-9, 9-13, 13-18, 18-25, 25-35, 35-50]
# Example: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0] = 2 tumors 4-6mm + 1 tumor 18-25mm
#
# For DIFFUSION training:
#   in_channels: 1 = noisy_seg
#   out_channels: 1 = predicted seg
#   conditioning: 7-dim size bin vector (FiLM modulation on timestep embed)
#   Dataloader: create_seg_conditioned_dataloader()
