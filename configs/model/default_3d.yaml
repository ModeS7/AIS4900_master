# 3D DiffusionModelUNet Architecture Configuration
#
# MONAI's DiffusionModelUNet for 3D volumetric data.
# Memory-optimized settings for training on single GPU.
#
# Architecture overview:
#   - 3D convolutions throughout
#   - Smaller channel counts for memory
#   - Attention only at deepest level
#   - Single ResBlock per level

type: unet                           # Model type: unet
spatial_dims: 3                      # 3D volumetric data
image_size: 256                      # H, W dimensions
depth_size: 160                      # D dimension

# Smaller architecture for 3D memory constraints
channels: [64, 128, 256]             # Fewer channels than 2D
attention_levels: [false, false, true]  # Attention only at bottleneck
num_res_blocks: 1                    # Single ResBlock per level
num_head_channels: 32                # Smaller attention heads
