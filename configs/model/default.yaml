# DiffusionModelUNet Architecture Configuration
#
# MONAI's DiffusionModelUNet with configurable depth and attention.
# Override via CLI: python -m medgen.scripts.train model.image_size=256
#
# Architecture overview:
#   - Encoder: progressive downsampling with ResBlocks
#   - Middle: attention blocks at bottleneck
#   - Decoder: progressive upsampling with skip connections

image_size: 128                      # Input image size (must be power of 2)
channels: [128, 256, 256]            # Channels at each encoder level
attention_levels: [false, true, true]  # Where to apply self-attention
num_res_blocks: 1                    # ResBlocks per encoder/decoder level
num_head_channels: 256               # Attention head dimension
