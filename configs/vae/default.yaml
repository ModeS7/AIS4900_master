# VAE Architecture Configuration (AutoencoderKL)
#
# Shared VAE architecture settings.
# Based on MONAI 2D implementation.
#
# Reference: https://github.com/Project-MONAI/GenerativeModels/issues/378
#
# Architecture overview:
#   - Encoder: progressive downsampling with ResBlocks
#   - Bottleneck: latent space with KL regularization
#   - Decoder: progressive upsampling with skip connections

# Latent space
latent_channels: 3                          # Latent space channels

# Encoder/Decoder architecture
channels: [64, 128, 256, 512]               # Channels at each level
attention_levels: [false, false, false, true]  # Where to apply attention
num_res_blocks: 2                           # ResBlocks per level

# Loss weights (MONAI defaults)
kl_weight: 1.0e-6         # KL divergence weight
perceptual_weight: 0.001  # Perceptual loss weight
adv_weight: 0.01          # Adversarial loss weight (GAN)

# Discriminator config (PatchGAN)
disable_gan: false        # Set true to skip discriminator entirely (saves VRAM)
disc_lr: 5.0e-4           # Discriminator learning rate
disc_num_layers: 3        # PatchDiscriminator depth
disc_num_channels: 64     # PatchDiscriminator base channels
